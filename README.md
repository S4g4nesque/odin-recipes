# odin-recipes
A project from the Odin Project linked to GitHub

The main task of the project is to make a homepage for 4 different recipes, with each recipe listed linking to its own page. 

Skills practiced here are:
- getting used to typing up standard html boilerplate
- using headings as well as paragraphs
- adding images and good practice with use of attributes ("alt" in particular)
- using ordered+unordered lists
- creating relative links for each recipe

Takeaway's:
- workflow: 
    - ctrl+arrow-key allows you to navigate faster through text (cursor moves in "chunks" rather than individual characters)
    
    - noticing typing habits that could be improved to better workflow (use of left vs right hand for shift+key)

- code: 
        - still getting getting accustomed to use of whitespace
        using a new line (not break) in the middle of a paragraph makes for easier reading

        - copy paste is not only easier but gives a sense of consistency across pages,
        but still practicing typing from scratch to solidify things learned
