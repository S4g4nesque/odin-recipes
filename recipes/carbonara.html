            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>200g guanciale</li>
                <li>black pepper</li>
                <li>as much pecorino as you'd like</li>
                <li>1 egg per person, plus one yolk</li>
                <li>400g spaghetti</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to cook it:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the pan, but go ahead and put in the guanciale as it's heating to render the fat</li>
                <li>Boil water, salt, and throw the spaghetti in</li>
                <li>In a bowl, beat eggs, grate in some pecorino, and add a generous amount of pepper</li>
                <li>Once the pasta is done, toss it into the pan with the guanciale. 
                    <em>*Make sure the pan is warm, not hot! Otherwise the eggs you put in will scramble.</em></li>
                <li>Stir in the egg "sauce" so it cooks ever so slightly with the residual heat</li>
                <li>Place into a bowl and enjoy!</li>
                
            </ol>
