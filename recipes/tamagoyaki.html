        <p><em>A traditional Japanese omelette seasoned with bonito stock.</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>This dish has a special place in my heart as it's an omelette my mother used to 
            make for me frequently as a kid. <br> In Tokyo they like to add sugar for a touch of sweet,
            but since my mother is from Kansai we're going simple and savory.
